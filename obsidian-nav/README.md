## Obsidian Portal custom navigation

See this Obsidian Portal docs article for more information:
https://help.obsidianportal.com/article/186-customizing-the-campaign-navigation

See this Obsidian Portal page for a list of all possible icons:
https://opfonticons.obsidianportal.com/wikis/main-page

The HTML snippet `obsidian-nav.html` is a custom navigation bar for the Shadow of the Seer
Obsidian Portal campaign. It adds navigation menu items for two pages that are not part of
the default Obsidian Portal navigation: the "Guilds" page and the "NPCs" page.

You can edit the icons Obsidian shows for the menu items by editing the
`obsidian-nav.html` to change the tags that begin like `icon-` or `op-icon-` to the name
of the icon you want to use. You can find the list of available icons at the page linked
at the top of this README.
